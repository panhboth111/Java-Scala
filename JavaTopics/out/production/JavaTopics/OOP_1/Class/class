A class is a blueprint from which objects are instantiated. It contains a collection of
properties and methods
=> constructor: used to instantiate objects.
    + it is invoked every time an object is created
    + it is a collection of statements because it is also a method
    + the constructor of the parent class can be called from the child class using super()
    => Types of constructors:
        1. default constructor: a constructor with no parameter
        2. parameterized constructor: a constructor with parameters or argument
    + In inheritance, default constructor of the parent class is called automatically if it
    contains no paramenter. Else, we must call it in the first line of the sub class's constructor
