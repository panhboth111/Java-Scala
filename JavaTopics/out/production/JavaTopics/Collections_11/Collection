=>Collection: Root interface with basic methods like add(), remove(),
              contains(), isEmpty(), addAll(), ... etc.
=>Set: Does not allow duplicates
=>List: Can contain duplicates and elements are ordered
=>Queue: Typically order elements in FIFO order except exceptions
         like PriorityQueue.
=> Deque : Elements can be inserted and removed at both ends. Allows
           both LIFO and FIFO.
=> Map : Contains Key value pairs. Doesn't allow duplicates.  Example
      implementation are HashMap and TreeMap.
