Multithreading is a Java feature that allows concurrent execution of two or more parts
of a program for maximum utilization of CPU.
=> A thread is an independent path of execution within a program.
    + It is a lightweight sub-process, the smallest unit of processing
=> Every Java program has at least one thread known as the main thread
=> In order to achieve multithreading we can:
    1. Extend the Thread class
    2. Implementing the Runnable interface

=> Thread class vs Runnable interface:
    + If we extend the thread class, we will not be able to extend other classes.
        - But, if we implement the Runnable interface, we will still be able to inherit
        other base classes
    + Extending the thread class means inheriting the basic in-build functionality of a
    thread like yield(), interrupt() which are not available in Runnable

=> Life cycle:
    1. New:
    2. Runnable:
    3. Running
    4. Waiting
    5. Dead
