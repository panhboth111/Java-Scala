Like a class, an interface can have methods and variables, but the methods declared in
interface are by default abstract (only method signature, no body).
=> A class inherits interfaces through the "implements" keyword.
=> an interface inherits other interfaces through the "extends" keyword
=> Interfaces specify what a class must do and not how. It is the blueprint of the class.
=> Interfaces support multiple inheritance
=> any class that implements an interface must override all of its methods or be declared abstract
=> It is used to achieve total abstraction
