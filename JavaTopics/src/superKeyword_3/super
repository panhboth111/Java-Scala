The super keyword in java is a reference variable that is used to refer parent class
=> uses of super:
    + Use of super with variables
    + Use of super with methods
    + Use of super with constructors
=> important:
    + the call to super() must be the first statement of the child class's constructor
    + if super() is not called explicitly, a no argument constructor of the parent class
    will be automatically inserted.
        - if the constructor of the parent class contains parameters, it will result in runtime error
        unless super() with appropriate arguments are passed.
