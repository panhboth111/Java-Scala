A list is a collection which contains immutable data. List represents linked list in
Scala. The Scala List class holds a sequenced, linear list of items.
    + In a Scala list, each element must be of the same type.
    + The implementation of lists uses mutable state internally during construction.
    + In Scala, list is defined under scala.collection.immutable package.
    + A List has various methods to add, prepend, max, min, etc. to enhance the usage of list.
