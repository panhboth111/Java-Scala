Closures functions are functions that use variables that are not declared inside the functions.
    + The return value of these functions are dependant uppon these variables
=> Closures function are categorized into two types:
    + pure: when the free variable is declared via "val" so its value cannot change throughout
    the program
    + impure: when the free variable is declared via "var" so its value is subject to change thus leads
    to different values
